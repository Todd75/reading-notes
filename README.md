*My reading notes for Code Fellows*

Hi my name is ~~Tod~~ oops I meant **Todd**. 

Growth Mindset means to <sub>me</sub> that if continue to learn through effort it will be succesful.

<sup>3</sup> Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- You are going to fail. This is going to happen often. Take a break reset your brain and do not get frustrated.
- Nothing worthwhile is easy. You will struggle, but be patient and it will come together for you.
- Take the critcism positively because it is meant to improve your skills.
