### 8 Commonly Used Data Structures

#### Arrays

An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

Array Operations:

- Traverse: Go through the elements and print them.
- Search: Search for an element in the array. You can search the element by its value or its index
- Update: Update the value of an existing element at a given index

#### Linked Lists

 A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.

1. Singly linked list — Traversal of items can be done in the forward direction only.
2. Doubly linked list — Traversal of items can be done in both forward and backward directions. Nodes consist of an additional pointer known as prev, pointing to the previous node.
3. Circular linked lists — Linked lists where the prev pointer of the head points to the tail and the next pointer of the tail points to the head.

#### Stacks

#### Queues

#### Hash Tables

#### Trees

#### Heaps

A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.

#### Graphs

graphs consist of finite sets of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these. The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.Two nodes are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.

A graph G is said to be a directed graph if all its edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex. A graph G is said to be an undirected graph if all its edges have no direction. It can go in both ways between the two vertices. If a vertex is not connected to any other node in the graph, it is said to be isolated.

## Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

2. How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
