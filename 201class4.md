## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address (URL).

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an `<a>` element and using the `href` attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

An attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.

*absolute URL:* Points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name.

*relative URL:* Points to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from, more like what we looked at in the previous section.
*Use clear link wording*

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.
- Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
- Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).
- Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
- Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".
